Build the java application using maven
sonarqube basically used for the image scanning part, will try to setup the sonar server locally and will send the report of code execution static code analysis to sonarqube
then build the docker image and push it to the docker hub and using the shell scripts will directly update
in the gitops approach we need to maintain a separate repo for manifest files or use the source code repo and create a new folder for manifest files inside the source code repo
using the shell script/argocd image updater will automatically update the manifest repo
using the manifest will automatically deploy into k8s through argocd


cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

use docker containers as agents - because we can lessen the configuration

whenever we deal with the popular controllers, the installation of the tool should be done through operators, which manages the lifecycle of k8s controllers

build the code through maven

run the static code analysis

build the image and push it to the artifactory

shell script which updates the manifest repo

continous delivery through gitops model(argocd)

varibalize with build with parmeters
