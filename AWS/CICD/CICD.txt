we would like our code resided in a repository and have it deployed onto aws
Automatically
The right way
Making sure it's tested before being deployed
with possibility to go into different stages (dev, test, staging, pre-prod and prod)
with manual approval where needed
version control: various changes that happened to code over time (and possibly roll back)
Each pipeline stage can create artifacts
Artifacts whatever is created outta pipeline
Artifacts are stored in s3 bucket and passed on to next stage and this is how the next stage is going to be able to do what it needs to do 
cloutrail can be used to audit AWS API calls
buildspec.yml for codebuilsd and appspec.yml for codedeploy
