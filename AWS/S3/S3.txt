S3 is one of the main building bocks of aws
it's advertised as infinitely scaling storage
Many websites use s3 as backbone
aws services use s3 as an integration as well
Buckets must have globally unique name across all regions all accounts ever created in aws
s3 allows people to store objects(files) in buckets (directories)
Buckets are defined at region level
The key is composed of prefix and object name
Max object size is 5TB(5000GB)
if uploading more than 5GB, must use multipart upload
s3 pre-signed url - this url basically contains a signature that verifies i'm the one making the request, and therefore it has my credentials in it and so because my credentials are encoded in the url, then amazon s3 says, then sudhamsh is allowed to view his own object
s3 versioning  - protect against unintended deletes(ability to restore a version and easy roll back to previous version)
The files that are uploaded has a version id null in which versioning is disabled and check the delete markers as well
S3 Replication - CRR/SRR - S3 Batch Replication for the retroactive stuff
S3 Requester pays
S3 Event Notifications
S3 performance(Multi upload, Transfer Acceleration and Byte-Range fetches, S3 batch operations)
storage lens - understand, analyze, and optimize storage across entire aws organizations
