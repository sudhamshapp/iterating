ec2 instance types
security groups - They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our ec2 instances
security groups only contains allow rules
security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group(sg can reference each other)
sg can be attached to multiple instances and a instance can have multiple security groups
locked down to a region
All inbound traffic is blocked by default
All outbound traffic is authorized by default
EBS volume is a network drive(i.e., not a physical drive) you can attach to your instances while they run
it allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
EBS volume is bound to a specific AZ(or locked to a specific AZ), to move a volume across, you first need to snapashot it
Multiple EBS volumes can be attached to a single instance and single ebs volume can be mounted on different instances(utpo 16 instances at a time)(except multi-attach io1/io2)
snapshot - Backup of ebs volume at a point in time(volume>snapshot>volume)
Not necessary to deatch volume to do snapshot, but recommend, can copy snapashot across AZs/Regions
scalability(vertical scalability and Horizontal scalability) and high availability
load balancers are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers downstream(ec2 instances)
